Step 1       Calibrate Accelerometer Offset and Slope
 Place the board on a horizontal surface with one of its axes vertical and hit enter to start a calibration
 measurement. Each of the axes must be measured pointing up and pointing down, so a total of 6 measurements.
 The program recognises which axis is vertical and shows which were measured successfully. If the angle is too
 far oblique the measurement is not valid.\n  

Step 2       CALIBRATE GYROSCOPE OFFSET
First choose the sample frequency (ODR) and the Full Scale value. The accelerometer and the gyroscope
share their ODR, so the setting here must be the same as in the DIY_Calibration_Gyroscope sketch.
This is far more important for the Gyroscope than for the accelerometer.
Next enter "O" to start the gyroscope offset measurement. 
During this offset measurement the sensor must be kept still.

Step 3       CALIBRATE GYROSCOPE SLOPE
During a slope calibration the sensor must be rotated calmly about one axis over a known angle.
Change the angle to your convenience. A larger angle is more accurate, but more difficult to do.
The rotation must be pure, without much rotation about the other two axes. It can be done by hand.
Keeping the board on a flat surface with the rotation axis vertical while turning is good enough.
For an accurate result you can start and end with its side pushed against a non moving object.
When you're done turning the sensor, press (Enter) to stop measuring. Each of the axes X,Y and Z
must be measured. The program automatically detects which.
